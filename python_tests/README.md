### Python Integration Tests

```tests.py``` contains simple integration tests for testing the TaskFactory JSON Result Sample App. Instructions are included as comments in code.

To set up a Python environment to run these tests, you can read the documentation in the [Cytoscape Automation Python Scripters repository](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python#installation).

For information on why these tests are included and how they are designed, read the [Integration Testing Wiki](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/wiki/App-Developers:-Integration-Testing).
